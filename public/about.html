<p>[Roger calling Hayley on the phone]  Roger the Alien: Hayley? Roger. Got a sec? Hayley Smith: Roger? Whoah! Is this one of those Twilight Zone phones where I can talk to the dead, but only with horrible, ironic consequences? Roger the Alien: Oh, right, it's past noon, you're already high.</p>
<p>Francine Smith: We're so glad you could make it. Where's your wife this evening? Avery Bullock: Handcuffed to a radiator in Fallujah. She wanted to come, but I do not negotiate with terrorists. Hey, do I smell meat loaf?</p>
<p>Roger the Alien: Hey, with this mortar launcher, we can get back at the kid who went all Tom Sizemore on your eye! Steve Smith: Oh, I wish I could get back at him. I'm gonna dress up as a girl and get him to have sex with me and then say "Ha! I'm not a girl! You just had sex with a boy that hates you!" Roger the Alien: Yes, let's leave that plan between you, me, and the string of therapists who won't be able to help you.</p>
<p>Stan Smith [picks up the phone]: This is Stan Smith. Principal Lewis: Mr. Smith, I'm afraid there's a problem with your son. Stan Smith: Oh, God, he's gay. This is it. This is the gay call. I've been ready for this for years. [starts chugging down pills] Principal Lewis: Uhh, no. It's just that he's gone mad with power. He evacuated the entire school and barricaded himself in my office. Stan Smith: I see. [foam starts coming out of his mouth] Stan Smith: Henry, antidote.</p>
<p>Steve Smith: Dad! There you are. Stan Smith: Of course I'm here. W-Where would I be? Alone, touching myself? Steve Smith: Yeah, right. Only perverts and Democrats do that. Stan Smith [Laughs]: Well said, soldier.</p>
